    * How long did it take to finish the test?
      Around 1 hour

    * If you had more time, how could you improve your solution?
      Not really . As a proof of concept its enough.

    * What changes would you do to your solution to be deployed in a production environment?
      Consider high availability and perfomance of the infra. Deploy this with some container orchestration tool (k8s p.e)
      Using a helm chart. Did something similar in one of my other repos, for a fpm app in minikube, see
      https://github.com/evilsysadmin/k8s

    * Why did you choose this language over others?
      Im more familiar with python. And golang is a bitr grumpy telling you warnings are errors!

    * What was the most challenging part and why?
      Not really challenging. Just maybe the openssl syntax , for the self signed cert, didnt remember exactly the syntax,and wanted to automate the cert generation 100%
